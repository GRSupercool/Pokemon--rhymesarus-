# wats1030-intro-to-unix
A repository designed to help students walk through a set of introductory Unix/Linux command line exercises.

In order to learn how to use the Unix/Linux command line we will walk through a set of common tasks developers often perform on the command line. Think of this less as a project you are working to complete, and more of an obstacle course meant to help you train and assess your skills. The easier all of these tasks get, the better. No developer should be without basic command line skills.

Please note that there are differences between different types of Linux and between Linux and Unix. This assignment focuses on commands and techniques generally supported across all *nix (Unix and Linux) operating systems.

## Format Using Markdown
Please note that your results document is a `.md` file, and you should use Github-Flavored Markdown to make it more readable and understandable. For example, pasting the results of your commands reads more easily if you use a code block like this:

```
$ ping google.com
PING google.com (216.58.217.14): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 216.58.217.14: icmp_seq=0 ttl=54 time=43.643 ms
64 bytes from 216.58.217.14: icmp_seq=1 ttl=54 time=66.435 ms

You can [consult this handy guide for formatting using Markdown all across Github](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Also, consult the [Basic Writing and Formatting Syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) page for quick reference about how you can use formatting to improve your results file.  (Don't forget that you can always look at the source code for any `.md` file you find on Github, including this one, to see how the author made certain formatting happen.)

## Basic Requirements
The *basic requirements* for completing this assignment are:

1. Clone your personal fork of this repository to a Unix or Linux development environment (Code Anywhere, local machine, etc.)
2. Use the command line to complete the challenges in the *nix Scavenger Hunt file: `nix_scavenger_hunt.md`
3. Edit the `nix_scavenger_hunt.md` file to put in your responses to each challenge
4. Commit and push your changes back to Github for review

## Stretch Requirements
The *stretch requirements* for this assignment are:

1. Complete the challenge found in the `nix_scavenger_hunt_stretch.md` file. It will take more than one step, and you will definitely know when you have found the answer.
